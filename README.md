# Anatomy Chatbot

This chatbot, implemented using the Gemini API, is designed to train on anatomy-based textbooks in PDF format. It processes the content of the textbooks and allows users to query the material. The chatbot leverages advanced NLP techniques to provide accurate, context-aware responses to any anatomy-related questions, making it a valuable tool for students, researchers, and medical professionals seeking quick and reliable information from the text.
